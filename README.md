### Reflection
<!-- Edit the following section with your reflection -->

#### What went well?
Finding out what questions were best to use
#### What did not go well?
Just not being able to commit properly but found out how
#### What did you learn?
How to find data sources. Based on those data sources, what can you analayze and find the conculsion.
#### What would you do differently next time?
Learn how to commit changes.

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bashgitg
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.

Machine Learning Plan:

I am planning on using Linear Regression as a Machine Learning Model.
Some challenges I might come across are:
1) Not Understanding terms and definintion like what a pipeline is.
2) Not knowing what to do if I come across some errors.

I plan to address these challenges by:
1) Understanding terms and defintion and understand how to implement by watching course videos again
2) And if I do come across some errors, I will use CO-PILOT to correct errors, look through  websites like stack overflow on what I can do to correct these errors and take help from the professor


Machine Learning Implementation Process:

1) First I will find out what answer I will need to find out.
2) I will then download the data, and upload it.
3) I will find any missing values and handle some erros if I come across any. 
4) Then I will process the data. I will train the data set, then I will build a machine learning pipeline
4) I will then analyze the data by figuring out any patterns and identify it.
5) Finally I will evaluate by looking for the best model.


On previous feedback, I received how I have to make minor refinements in correlation analysis and ML detailing.
